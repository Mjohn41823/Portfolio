            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <!--About me section here with list of characteristics-->
            <p>-For most of my life I have watched as technology has advanced and has helped people be more connected, information flow more freely and improved our lives. I have strived to learn as much as possible about technology and the "languages" of computers and the internet. I have made it my goal in life to be a life long learning of technology and help others improve their lives and businesses thru technology. Technology has always been a team sport; whether it be with a team of developers or technologists, I always strive to help the team move forward in completing thier goals. </p>
            <p>-I would enjoy the chance to help any business or individual with their website needs, building an application or just helping fixing or updating their current website. </p>
