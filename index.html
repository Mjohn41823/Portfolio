        <h3>About Me</h3><!--About me section here with list of characteristics-->

        <p>-For most of my life I have watched as technology has advanced and has helped
        people be more connected, information flow more freely and improved our lives. I
        have strived to learn as much as possible about technology and the "languages" of
        computers and the internet. I have made it my goal in life to be a life long
        learning of technology and help others improve their lives and businesses thru
        technology. Technology has always been a team sport; whether it be with a team of
        developers or technologists, I always strive to help the team move forward in
        completing thier goals.</p>

        <p>-I would enjoy the chance to help any business or individual with their
        website needs, building an application or just helping fixing or updating their
        current website.</p><!--Second ordered list-->
